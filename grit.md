# Grit

> Our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another.\
> <cite>Angela Duckworth, [Grit](https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108)</cite> 

This is *such* an attractive thesis: for all of us, success is within reach.
The book's fun to read, and the argument is clearly presented. (I wish more
scientists wrote books like this.) That said, "grit trumps everything" seems
too neat a conclusion for something as complex as human achievement. Throughout
the book, there's not much discussion of the evidence for alternative
explanations of success, and most of the studies cited were done by the author
or closely-affiliated researchers (and the scientific literature has a
widespread [reproducibility
crisis](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/psychologys-replication-crisis-real/576223/)).
(Update: [this
article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620920531)
specifically attacks the grit thesis and cites many of Duckworth's papers, but
the actual study is behind a paywall.)

## Quotes

The book is clear and fun, but doesn't lend itself to great quotes. The quotes
Duckworth pulls from other works are *amazing*, though!

> You have made a convert of an opponent in one sense, for I have always
> maintained that, excepting fools, men did not differ much in intellect, only
> in zeal and hard work; and I still think this is an *eminently* important
> difference.\
> <cite>Charles Darwin, quoted in Chapter 2</cite>

> Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. Our fires are
> dampened, our drafts are checked. We are making use of only a small part of
> our possible mental and physical resources.\
> <cite>William James, quoted in Chapter 2</cite>

> No one can see in the work of the artist how it has *become*. That is its
> advantage, for whenever one can see the act of becoming one grows somewhat
> cool...Our vanity, our self-love, promotes the cult of the genius. For if we
> think of genius as something magical, we are not obliged to compare ourselves
> and find ourselves lacking...To call someone "divine" means: "here there is
> no need to compete."\
> <cite>Nietzsche, quoted in Chapter 3</cite>

> Dancing appears glamorous, easy, delightful. But that path to the paradise of
> that achievement is not easier than any other. There is fatigue so great that
> the body cries even in its sleep. There are times of complete frustration.
> There are daily small deaths.\
> <cite>Martha Graham, quoted in Chapter 7</cite>

> The true joy in life is to be a force of fortune instead of a feverish,
> selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world
> will not devote itself to making you happy.\
> <cite>George Bernard Shaw, quoted in Chapter 12</cite>

> Success is never final; failure is never fatal. It's courage that counts.\
> <cite>John Wooden, quoted in Chapter 12</cite>

## Notes

- We're distracted by talent. Intellectually agree that effort matters more,
  but still choose to hire for "naturals."
- Effort counts twice: `achievement = effort * skill = effort * (effort * talent)`
- Grit scale (p. 55): passion plus perseverance
    - Goals are a tree. Single top-level goal (e.g., "use psychological science
      to help kids thrive") optimizes grit, maybe one for personal and one for
      work.
    - Low-level goals are instrumental, swap freely in pursuit of high-level
      goals. High- and mid-level goals are long-term, need focus and passion.
- Grit grows over time. Partially hereditary, partially experience. Necessity
  as catalyst (e.g., need to take care of parents).
    - Passion: research shows that when people are interested in their work,
      they're more satisfied and they perform better. Passion comes from
      discovery, then development, then deepening. Triggered by repeat
      experiences, not introspection.
    - Practice: kaizen. ~10y, ~10k hours of *deliberate* practice. To one
      researcher, it's demanding, exhausting, impossible to sustain for more
      than an hour at a time. Another calls it flow---ecstatic, effortless, in
      the moment. Duckworth: gritty people do more deliberate practice *and*
      experience more flow. Practice is for preparation, flow is for
      performance. "In other words, there are *different kinds* of positive
      experience: the thrill of getting better is one, and the ecstasy of
      performing at your best is another."
        - Deliberate practice requires a clearly defined stretch goal, full
          concentration and effort, immediate and informative feedback, and
          repetition with reflection and refinement.
        - Make it a habit.
        - Change the way you experience it: no shame, no recriminations.
    - Purpose: tie goal to others
    - Hope: optimism, belief that setbacks are due to temporary circumstances.
      Hopelessness is a lack of perceived control. Fixed v growth mindset.
- Inculcating grit in others
    - Parenting: must be wise, i.e. supportive and demanding, to encourage
      emulation. Then model grit.
    - "The playing fields of grit." Learned industriousness. Two years of
      sustained effort in one HS extracurricular, with a significant
      accomplishment.
    - Culture of grit.
- Summary: intrapersonal, interpersonal, and intellectual character (will,
  heart, mind). Grit is intrapersonal.
