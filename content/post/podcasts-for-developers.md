Even though computer science doesn't change too quickly, software engineering
changes all the time. New libraries, languages, and architectural patterns
emerge, jump the shark, and die, only to re-emerge a few years later. How's a
working engineer supposed to keep up without spending every free moment
on Hacker News?

*Podcasts*, that's how. Unfortunately, most podcasts are meandering
stream-of-consciousness monologues recorded on a laptop microphone. After a few
years of avid listening, though, I've found a pretty good selection of shows
--- if you share my interests in web development, data science, and startups,
you may find something you like. All these podcasts regularly produce great
episodes, but I listen to the three-star shows religiously and the one-star shows
only if the topic sounds appealing.

If you know of a great show that isn't on my list, [let me
know](mailto:akshay@akshayshah.org) --- I'm always looking for something new.

## Podcatchers
A quick word on podcasting clients: the official podcast clients from Apple and
Google are okay, but it's worth spending a few dollars to get a top-notch
third-party app. If you're on iOS, Marco Arment's
[Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) is simply *amazing*.
