# Colophon

I'm Akshay Shah, and you've landed on my little patch of the web --- mazel tov!
As a brief introduction, I'm an infrastructure and platform engineer in San
Francisco. After stints at Uber, Microsoft, and many startups (including my
own), I'm now the Field CTO at [Antithesis][]. If you'd like to get in
touch with me, you can send me an [email][]; I'm also on [Bluesky][],
[LinkedIn][], and [GitHub][].

The first thing you'll notice is that I'm the kind of person who calls this page
the colophon. What can I say? "About Me," "Meet Akshay," and "The Happy Homepage
for Rainbow Ponies" are just _so_ pedestrian. I like semicolons, em-dashes,
parenthetical asides, fountain pens, and suede elbow patches, too.

I'm easily excited --- show me something intriguing, and I'll happily spend
weeks reading and experimenting. In the past, I've made fountain pen nibs and
medieval iron-gall ink, roasted my own coffee beans and opened a small espresso
shop, led a cross-country bicycle trip, and mistakenly concocted an underwater
blasting compound. Thus far, all lost fingertips have been successfully
reattached.

Professionally, I've been a public school teacher, an EMT, and a medical
student. After completing my medical degree in 2011, I moved to California and
left medicine for a career in software. Most of my experience is in
infrastructure and platform engineering at growing startups, including streaming
data infrastructure, service-to-service networking, RPC, and the Go programming
language. I remain convinced that programming is the _best_ job on Earth.
