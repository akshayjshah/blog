# Podcasts for Developers

Even though computer science doesn't change too quickly, software engineering
changes all the time. New libraries, languages, and architectural patterns
emerge, jump the shark, and die, only to re-emerge a few years later. How's a
working engineer supposed to keep up without spending every free moment
on Hacker News?

*Podcasts*, that's how. Unfortunately, most podcasts are meandering
monologues recorded on a laptop microphone. After a few
years of avid listening, though, I've found a pretty good selection of
shows---if you share my interests in web development, data science, and startups,
you may find something you like. All these podcasts regularly produce great
episodes, but I listen to the three-star shows religiously and the one-star shows
only if the topic sounds appealing.

If you know of a great show that isn't on my list, [let me
know](mailto:akshay@akshayshah.org)---I'm always looking for something new.

## Podcatchers
A quick word on podcasting clients: the official podcast clients from Apple and
Google are okay, but it's worth spending a few dollars to get a top-notch
third-party app. If you're on iOS, Marco Arment's
[Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) is simply *amazing*.
