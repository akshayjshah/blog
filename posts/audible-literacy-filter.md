Especially among technical folks, writing is an underrated skill. Kyle Wiens
hit the front page of Hacker News by blogging about his use of a writing test
to screen engineering applicants. While I'm not completely convinced that "at
its core, code is prose," I do believe that facility with prose is both
valuable in itself and a good proxy for attention to detail. Many authors have
made the former point, often [specifically addressing startups][rww], and Kyle
himself does an excellent job making the latter connection. However, not all of
us are willing (or allowed) to administer a writing test as part of the
interview process. For the rushed curmudgeon, I offer a shortcut: focus on the
candidate's use of the word "myself."

## An Easy, Audible Grammar Test

Many guides to grammar gaffes focus on homophones---pairs of words that
have different meanings but identical pronunciations.  But relying on
homophones to sort the literate wheat from the unemployable chaff is difficult
precisely because they sound alike; using homophones to detect your candidate's
illiteracy requires a written test.  (The most obliging candidates display
their ignorance in a resume or cover letter, but not everyone is so
forthright.) Focusing on "myself" avoids this trap, since misuse is easily
flagged in speech and in writing.

Like "whom," "myself" is tricky because correct usage demands some knowledge of
formal grammar. It's only appropriate in two cases:

* When the speaker is both the subject and the object of a verb, e.g., "Oops, I must have
  sent that email to myself."
* When used for emphasis, e.g., "I fixed that bug myself."

A good rule of thumb is to be suspicious of any sentence that includes "myself"
but not "I." Most importantly, "myself" is *not* just a fancy substitute for "me" or
"I." These are two incorrect, but sadly common, constructions:

* "Feel free to bring up any concerns with Bob or myself." (Replace with "Bob
  or me.")
* "Jane and myself will go to the meeting." (Replace with "Jane and I.")

And there you have it---a simple, audible grammar test. Its
false-positive rate is low, and it's particularly good at detecting the overly
self-important candidate (or co-worker).

## Update

Well, *someone* here was certainly self-important. With a few more years of
workplace experience under my belt, I've mostly outgrown this opinion: clear
writing is valuable, but correct reflexive pronoun usage is a better signal of
a privileged education than intelligence or attention to detail.
