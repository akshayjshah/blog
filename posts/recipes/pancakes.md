# Pancakes

In addition to the recipes below, [PBR waffle batter](/recipes/waffles/) also
makes good pancakes.

## Buttermilk Pancakes

### Ingredients

* 1.5c all-purpose flour
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp table salt
* 1.5c buttermilk or clabbered milk
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tbsp melted butter
* 1 tsp vanilla

### Instructions

1. Whisk together the dry and wet ingredients separately. Add the dry to the
   wet and stir until just combined.
2. Cook in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown, 2--3m per side.
   Depending on the skillet, you may need a bit of butter or neutral oil to
   prevent sticking.

## Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes

### Ingredients
* 4 eggs, separated
* 12 oz whole-milk ricotta cheese
* 1.5 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp lemon zest
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* 3/4 c flour
* 1 tsp table salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda

### Instructions
1. Whip egg whites until stiff peaks form.
2. In a second bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and baking soda.
2. In a third bowl, mix yolks, ricotta, sugar, zest, and lemon juice. Add flour
   mixture and stir until just combined. Gently fold in whipped egg whites.
3. Cook in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown, 2--3m per side.
   Depending on the skillet, you may need a bit of butter or neutral oil to
   prevent sticking.

## Notes

* To make clabbered milk, add 1.5 tbsp lemon juice to 1.5c milk. Most recipes
  suggest letting the milk sit for 10m to thicken, but [Cook's Illustrated says
  that resting is
  counterproductive](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6356-resting-clabbered-milk).
  I'm usually making pancakes in a hurry, so I never rest the milk.
* The buttermilk recipe handles additions well: my family particularly liked versions
  with gingerbread spice mix and roasted kabocha squash puree. The ricotta
  recipe is a bit more temperamental, so I avoid bulky additions.
* Maple syrup and butter are classic toppings, but it doesn't take long to make
  a fresh fruit compote instead: just simmer a tablespoon of butter, some sliced
  fruits, and a bit of sugar until the fruits are soft and the sugar is melted.
