# Sourdough Starter

I adapted this approach from [The Perfect
Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/7-easy-steps-making-incredible-sourdough-starter-scratch/).
King Arthur Flour, the Tartine bread book, and every other sourdough-related
book or website also has a guide available. The basic approach is to start with
a whole-grain or rye flour (since they contain more yeasts and bacteria) and
higher hydration, switching to white flour and 100% hydration
([what?](/recipes/bakers-percentages)) once the culture takes hold.

## Ingredients

* Dark rye flour
* Unbleached all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Start with an all-rye, 150% hydration mixture. Cover loosely and incubate at
   room temp. (I started my culture in San Francisco’s cool season, so I kept
   my starter in the oven with the light on during this stage.) Every day,
   create a new starter with 150% hydration and 100% of the previous day’s
   starter (e.g., 10g rye flour, 10g starter, and 15g water). After about a
   week, the starter should be doubling in volume in 8-12 hours, then slowly
   falling.
2. Once the starter is well-established, transition to a dryer mixed-flour
   recipe. Use 100% hydration, 20% starter, and a 50-50 rye/all-purpose flour
   mix. Feed daily. I only bake occasionally, so I keep a small culture (30g of
   flour daily).
3. Optionally, preserve some of your well-established culture. Mix a big dollop
   of active starter with a scoop of the dry flour blend you've been feeding
   it. Incorporate with a spatula, then break apart clumps with your fingers.
   Continue breaking up clumps and adding flour until the mixture feels
   completely dry, then leave it to finish drying at room temperature for a few
   hours. Seal it in a jar and store it away from light and moisture. Revive by
   mixing the whole jar (or enough of it to get a healthy dose of your original
   starter) with 50g fresh flour and enough water to make it easy to stir. Mix
   until no dry bits remain, incubate at a warm room temperature until bubbly
   (usually 12--24 hours), then feed as usual.

## Notes

- Feeding the starter at the same time every day is helpful.
- Chlorinated or chloraminated water will kill your culture. Remove chlorine by
  leaving the water in an open container at room temperature for a few hours.
  San Francisco tap water is chloraminated, which is easiest to (mostly) remove
  by running it through a Brita pitcher.
- King Arthur Flour sells fresh, wet starter online. I haven’t tried it---if it
  works, it’d cut a lot of the guesswork out of this process. Some bakeries
  (including The Mill in SF) will also sell or give away their starter.
