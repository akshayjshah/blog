# Waffles

The sourdough waffles require more planning, but are more complex and crispy.
In a pinch, the beer waffles capture some of the complexity of the sourdough
version without the lengthy preparation.

The sourdough waffles are adapted from [King Arthur
Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/classic-sourdough-waffles-or-pancakes-recipe),
and the beer waffles are adapted from
[Macheesmo](https://www.macheesmo.com/pbr-beer-waffles/).

## Sourdough Waffles

### Ingredients

* 344g all-purpose flour
* 28g sugar
* 557g buttermilk or clabbered milk
* 20g sourdough starter
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 50g (1/4 c) vegetable oil or 57g butter (4 tbsp), melted
* 5g salt
* 5g baking soda
* 3g baking powder

### Instructions

1. Mix the flour, sugar, buttermilk, and starter. Cover and leave at room
   temperature overnight. (The sponge should be at maximum height in the
   morning. If it's started to fall, the waffles will be more sour. Adjust the
   fermentation temperature and the volume of the starter inoculation as
   necessary.)
2. In a bowl, whisk the eggs, butter or oil, and vanilla. Gently mix into the
   sponge.
3. Add the salt, baking soda, and baking powder. The batter should bubble.

## Beer Waffles

### Ingredients

* 240g (2 c) all-purpose flour
* 15g baking powder
* 12 oz can Pabst Blue Ribbon or similar light beer
* 8 tbsp butter, melted
* 1 c milk
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tbsp honey
* 1 tsp vanilla
* pinch salt

### Instructions

* Whisk dry ingredients.
* Mix in beer.
* In a separate bowl, whisk together wet ingredients, then gently mix into
  batter.
* Batter is ready to use immediately, but improves if left for up to half an
  hour before cooking.

## Notes

* If I'm in a rush and don't have any light beer, I make pancakes. I haven't
  found another quick waffle recipe that's worth the effort.
* The sourdough batter doesn't make good pancakes, but the beer batter does.
* Don't use fancier beers. Stick to light, nearly-flavorless lagers: Corona,
  Miller Lite, and Trader Jose's Light are all good PBR alternatives.
