# Focaccia

## Blitz Bread

Adapted slightly from [King Arthur
Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/blitz-bread-no-fuss-focaccia-recipe).


### Ingredients

- 418g bread flour (100%)
- 340g warm water (81%)
- 35g olive oil (for the dough) (8%)
- 8g salt (2%)
- 10g instant yeast (2.4%)
- 25g olive oil (to drizzle into the pan) (6%)
- Optional: chopped fresh or dried herbs

### Instructions

1. Use non-stick vegetable oil spray to lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. Drizzle
   olive oil atop the spray; the spray keeps the bread from sticking, while the
   olive oil flavors and crisps the crust.
2. Combine all of the ingredients, and beat at high speed with an electric
   mixer for 60 seconds. Scoop the sticky batter into the prepared pan, cover,
   and let it rise at room temperature for 60 minutes---it should be quite
   puffy, but not fragile-looking.
3. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375.
4. Gently poke the dough all over with wet fingers. Drizzle with olive oil
   and herbs.
5. Bake the bread until it's golden brown, 25--30 minutes.
6. Remove it from the oven, wait 5 minutes, then turn it out of the pan onto a
   rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

### Notes

Optionally, replace half the AP flour with whole wheat.

## Sourdough Focaccia

From [The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/a-simple-focaccia/).

### Ingredients

- 345g AP flour (70%)
- 148g malted bread flour (30%)
- 10g EVOO (2%)
- 394g water (80%)
- 9g salt (1.9%)
- 94g sourdough starter @ 100% hydration (19%)

### Instructions

1. Add starter, flour, and all but 50g of water to mixing bowl. Mix by hand
   until the dough forms a cohesive mass, then knead until smooth and elastic.
   (Can slap-and-fold by hand or use a machine with dough hook.)
2. After the dough is moderately strengthened, add the remaining 50g water
   slowly. Stop if the dough becomes soupy and doesnâ€™t come together with more
   kneading.
3. Add EVOO and knead 3--5m to incorporate. Dough will be very slack. Transfer
   to a covered container for bulk fermentation.
4. Stretch and fold every 30m for two hours. Transfer to oiled 9x13 pan for
   remaining two hour bulk fermentation. If necessary, gently stretch dough
   toward corners of pan every 30m.
5. Final proof, covered, for about 2h. Dough should be very gassy, and should
   have risen significantly in rectangular container. Poking it should feel
   like a soft marshmallow. (Optionally, cover in plastic wrap and proof in
   frig overnight instead. Allow dough to come back to room temp before
   continuing.)
6. Dimple dough with wet fingertips, drizzle with EVOO, sprinkle with herbs or
   other toppings, then bake at 450 for about 30m.
