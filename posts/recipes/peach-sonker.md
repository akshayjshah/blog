Sonkers are the turduckens of dessert: part pie, part cobbler, part pancake,
and all delicious.

- 2.5 lb (1134 g) peaches, peeled, halved, pitted, and sliced
- 0.5 c (100 g) sugar
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.25 c water
- 3 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 c all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 0.5 c whole milk
- 8 tbsp melted butter, still hot
- 0.25 tsp vanilla extract

1. Heat oven to 350.
2. Combine peaches, half the sugar, and 0.25 tsp salt in a bowl. Whisk together
   water and cornstarch in a second bowl, then add to the peaches and mix well.
3. Transfer mixture to an 8-inch square baking pan and bake for 40m, until the
   filling is bubbling around the sides. Halfway through, scrape the bottom of
   the pan and stir well with a rubber spatula.
4. Remove pan from oven, scrape, and stir again.
5. Combine flour, baking powder, remaining sugar, and 0.25 tsp salt in a bowl.
   Whisk in milk, melted butter, and vanilla, mixing until batter is smooth.
6. Pour batter over hot peaches, starting in a corner of the pan. Bake 35-40m,
   or until the top of the sonker is golden brown and a toothpick comes out
   clean.
7. Cool 15m and serve.

## Notes

- If peaches aren't in season, substitute 2 lb frozen peaches for fresh. Cook for an additional 20m
  in step 2.
- Sonker does not keep well. Eat shortly after cooking!
- For a shorter and sweeter life, top with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.
