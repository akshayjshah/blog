Serious bakers list ingredients by weight, because scooping technique and
humidity make volume-based measurement unreliable. Expressing weights as
percentages of the flour weight makes it even easier to scale recipes up and
down. This is completely different from normal math, where we'd use percentages
of the *total* weight.

There are two approaches to percentage-based sourdough baking: one breaks the
starter into flour and water weights, and the other treats it as a separate
ingredient (ignoring the flour content).

As an example, consider a mix of 100g flour, 100g water, 10g salt, and 10g
starter (itself an even mix of flour and water, aka 100% hydration). Using the
first approach, we'd calculate percentages like this:

| Ingredient | Weight | Baker's Percentage | Normal Percentage |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Flour      | 100g dry + 5g in starter | 100 | 47.7 |
| Water      | 100g + 5g in starter | 100 | 47.7 |
| Salt       | 10g | 9.5 | 4.6 |

Using the second approach, we'd have this:

| Ingredient | Weight | Baker's Percentage | Normal Percentage |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Flour      | 100g | 100 | 45 |
| Water      | 100g | 100 | 45 |
| Salt       | 10g | 10 | 5 |
| Starter    | 10g | 10 | 5 |

The Tartine bread book uses the second approach. Chad Robertson says that it's
more common in commercial bakeries: because the same starter is used in all the
recipes, it's easier to treat it as an ingredient rather than a mix of flour
and water. I do the same.
