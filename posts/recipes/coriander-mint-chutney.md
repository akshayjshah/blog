# Coriander and Mint Chutney

With Cholula hot sauce and Dijon mustard, this chutney completes my condiment
trinity. The miso isn't traditional, but it adds complexity and depth.

- 2 bunches cilantro, tough portions of stems removed
- 1 bunch of mint, leaves only
- 1--5 small, spicy green chiles (Thai, serrano, or similar)
- 0.25 small onion
- 5 cloves garlic
- Juice of 0.5 lemon
- 1 tbsp red miso (optional)
- 4 tbsp olive oil (optional)
- Salt to taste

Grind all the ingredients to a smooth paste, adding only half the chiles, lemon,
and salt. Taste before adding the remainder, adjusting as necessary.
Refrigerate, or cover with a thin layer of olive oil and freeze.
