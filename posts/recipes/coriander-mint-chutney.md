# Coriander and Mint Chutney

With Cholula hot sauce and Dijon mustard, this chutney completes my condiment
trinity. The miso isn't traditional, but it adds complexity and depth.

## Ingredients

* 2 bunches cilantro, tough portions of stems removed
* 1 bunch of mint, leaves only
* 1-5 small, spicy green chiles (Thai, serrano, or similar)
* 1/4 small onion
* 5 cloves garlic
* Juice of 1/2 lemon
* 1 tbsp red miso (optional)
* 4 tbsp olive oil (optional)
* Salt to taste

## Instructions

Grind all the ingredients to a smooth paste, adding only half the chiles,
lemon, and salt. Taste before adding the remainder, adjusting as necessary.
Refrigerate, or cover with a thin layer of olive oil and freeze.
