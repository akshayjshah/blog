# Methi Dal

## Ingredients

* 1/2 c dry toor dal
* 1/4 c chopped tomato (one Roma tomato)
* 3/4 c chopped methi (fenugreek) leaves and tender stems
* 1/2 c chopped white onion
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped
* 2 tbsp chopped cilantro
* 10 curry leaves
* 1 small, hot chili, chopped
* 1 tsp mustard seed
* 1/4 tsp turmeric
* 4 tbsp oil, ghee, or a mix of the two

## Instructions

1. Boil the dry toor dal with 2 cups water and the turmeric. Reduce to a simmer
   and cook until the dal is nearly falling apart (about an hour).
2. Pour off and reserve any cooking liquid from the dal.
3. Heat the oil or ghee. Drop a few mustard seeds into the cold pan; once they
   hiss and pop, put in the remaining mustard seeds, cover, and turn the heat
   down.
4. When the popping subsides and the oil is fragrant, add chili and curry
   leaves. When the oil stops foaming and you can smell the curry leaves, add
   the garlic and onions. Cook until the onions are translucent and the garlic
   is slightly browned but not burned.
5. Add the tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes are soft. Add the chopped methi
   and cook until wilted.
6. Add 1.5c of cooked dal and thin with cooking liquid to reach your desired
   consistency. Bring to a boil, then simmer for a few minutes to bring the
   flavors together. Add salt to taste, then sprinkle chopped cilantro on top.

## Notes

* The oil should be relatively hot when toasting the mustard seeds, curry
  leaves, and chili, but make sure to let the pan cool before adding the garlic
  and onions.
* This recipe is also good with chayote (or any other squash) instead of methi.
* You can make the toor dal ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator. The
  cooking liquid will separate from the dal overnight.
