I loved Robin Sloan's *Sourdough*. (What can I say, I'm a standard-issue
pandemic nerd.) It's light, fun, and occasionally funny, but still asks hard
questions: can technology further our culture, or only erase it? Can culture be
shared, or only appropriated?

That's high-minded stuff, but so many of the book's small details spoke to me.
Sloan nails programming in San Francisco: the constant exhortations to work
harder and change the world, the disconnect between high-flying fundraising
decks and the kludgy heuristics that actually run the machines, and the sense
of wonder that a coding breakthrough brings. It's easy to see myself in Lois,
the book's protagonist.

One hint at a time, Sloan also builds a hauntingly beautiful picture of the
Mazg, the fictional community of stateless European migrants who nurtured
Lois's sourdough culture through centuries of wandering. I regret not listening
to the audiobook version of *Sourdough* --- it includes computer-generated Mazg
music! Some samples are included in this [blog
post](https://www.mcdbooks.com/features/sourdough), which is also the best
non-technical description of machine learning I've found.

I love San Francisco, and programming, and cooking, and I worry that nerds like
me have destroyed our city (and possibly our country). I'm also the cofounder of
a young startup, hoping to make some small change in our culture. I left
*Sourdough* struck by this quote from the mysterious backer of the Marrow
Fair:

> “It is no small thing to change a culture,” Horace said simply. “But I think
> interesting things are growing here. Lucrative enterprises. Provocative
> tastes.”
